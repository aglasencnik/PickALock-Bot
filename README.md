# Pick A Lock Bot

PickALock-Bot is a repository for an application that plays the Pick A Lock game on Y8.

## Project Status
The project development is currently slow, since I (the lead developer) am still going to school, and I am not an expert in this field yet.

## Installation

Under releases select the the latest version of the application and download the .exe file.

After downloading the application double-click on the .exe file, and the install wizzard will lead you through the installation process.

## Usage
Before you can start using PickALock-Bot application you must firstly calibrate the program.

Step 1: Go to the game website.

Step 2: Open the PickALock-Bot app, or just have it above you're game's website.

Step 3: Click "Calibrate" button, and just like in snipping tool select just the area where the game is (green area) after that click OK after inspecting the picture.

Step 4: Now press play on the game so it fails the first time.

Step 5: Now you can click the "Start" button or press the F9 key, and do NOT do anything while the game is playing.

After you think the bot has played enough go back to the app and click the "Stop" button or just press "F9" key to stop the app.
